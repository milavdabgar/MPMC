## Write a program using MUL instruction to multiply two bytes 05h and 03h. (3)

```assembly
ORG 0000H ; Set the starting address of the program to 0000H

MOV A, #05H   ; Load the first byte (multiplicand) into the accumulator
MOV B, #03H   ; Load the second byte (multiplier) into register B

MUL AB        ; Multiply the contents of A and B (result stored in A and B)

; At this point, the lower byte of the result is in the accumulator (A)
; and the higher byte of the result is in register B.

; Example: To store the result in memory
MOV 40H, A    ; Store the lower byte in memory location 40H
MOV 41H, B    ; Store the higher byte in memory location 41H

END           ; End of program
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ORG 0000H:** This directive tells the assembler that the code should be placed starting from memory address 0000H.
2. **MOV A, #05H:** This instruction loads the immediate value 05H (the first number) into the accumulator register (A).
3. **MOV B, #03H:** This instruction loads the immediate value 03H (the second number) into register B.
4. **MUL AB:** This is the core multiplication instruction. It multiplies the contents of the accumulator (A) with the contents of register B. The 16-bit result is stored across the accumulator (lower byte) and register B (higher byte).
5. **MOV 40H, A / MOV 41H, B:** These instructions are an example of how you would store the result in memory. Here, the lower byte of the result is stored at address 40H and the higher byte at 41H.

**Important Notes:**

- The 8051 can only multiply 8-bit numbers. The result of 05H \* 03H = 0FH (15), fits within a single byte so there's no overflow in this case.
- If the result was larger than 255 (FFh), the overflow flag (OV) in the program status word (PSW) would be set.

## Write an ALP to multiply two numbers stored at 30h and 31h in RAM. Store answer at HSB 51H and LSB 52H. (4)

```assembly
ORG 0000H  ; Start the program at memory address 0000H

MOV A, 30H ; Load the first number from RAM location 30H into A
MOV B, @A  ; Move the value pointed to by A (the first number) into B

INC A      ; Increment A to point to the second number (31H)
MOV A, @A  ; Move the value pointed to by A (the second number) into A

MUL AB     ; Multiply the two numbers

MOV 52H, A ; Store the LSB of the result at memory location 52H
MOV 51H, B ; Store the MSB of the result at memory location 51H

END        ; End of program
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ORG 0000H:** Indicates the starting memory address for the program.
2. **MOV A, 30H:** Loads the memory address 30H into the accumulator (A).
3. **MOV B, @A:** Indirect addressing. Moves the contents of the memory location pointed to by A (which contains the first number) into register B.
4. **INC A:** Increments A to point to location 31H, where the second number is stored.
5. **MOV A, @A:** Loads the second number (from location 31H) into the accumulator.
6. **MUL AB:** Multiplies the number in the accumulator (A) with the number in register B.
7. **MOV 52H, A:** Stores the lower byte (LSB) of the result in memory location 52H.
8. **MOV 51H, B:** Stores the higher byte (MSB) of the result in memory location 51H.

## Write a program using DIV instruction to divide two bytes 09h and 02h. (3)

```assembly
ORG 0000H  ; Start the program at memory address 0000H

MOV A, #09H  ; Load the dividend (09h) into the accumulator
MOV B, #02H  ; Load the divisor (02h) into register B

DIV AB       ; Divide the accumulator (A) by register B
             ; Quotient will be in A, remainder in B

; Example: To store the results in memory
MOV 60H, A   ; Store the quotient in memory location 60H
MOV 61H, B   ; Store the remainder in memory location 61H

END          ; End of program
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ORG 0000H:** Sets the starting address of the program.
2. **MOV A, #09H:** Loads the dividend (the number to be divided) into the accumulator.
3. **MOV B, #02H:** Loads the divisor into register B.
4. **DIV AB:** Performs the division. The result (quotient) is stored in the accumulator (A), and the remainder is stored in register B.
5. **MOV 60H, A / MOV 61H, B:** These are example instructions to store the quotient and remainder in memory locations 60H and 61H, respectively.

**Important Notes:**

- **Integer Division:** The 8051 DIV instruction performs integer division, meaning any fractional part of the result will be discarded.
- **Overflow:** If the result of the division is too large to fit in the accumulator, the overflow flag (OV) will be set in the program status word (PSW). You'll need to add code to handle this potential overflow situation if it's relevant to your application.

**Result:**

In this case, 09h / 02h = 4 (quotient) with a remainder of 1.

# Write a program to divide two numbers stored at 20h and 21h. Store quotient on 40h and reminder at 41h. (4)

```assembly
ORG 0000H ; Set the program's starting address

MOV A, 20H    ; Load the address of the dividend into A
MOV B, @A     ; Move the dividend from RAM to register B
INC A         ; Increment A to point to the divisor
MOV A, @A     ; Move the divisor from RAM to the accumulator (A)

DIV AB        ; Divide the accumulator (A) by register B
              ; Quotient in A, remainder in B

MOV 40H, A    ; Store the quotient at memory location 40H
MOV 41H, B    ; Store the remainder at memory location 41H

END           ; End of program
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ORG 0000H:** Indicates the program starts at memory address 0000H.
2. **MOV A, 20H:** Loads the memory address 20H (where the dividend is stored) into the accumulator.
3. **MOV B, @A:** Indirect addressing. Loads the value at the memory location pointed to by A (the dividend) into register B.
4. **INC A:** Increments the accumulator to point to address 21H, where the divisor is stored.
5. **MOV A, @A:** Loads the value at the memory location pointed to by A (the divisor) into the accumulator.
6. **DIV AB:** Performs the division. The quotient is left in the accumulator (A) and the remainder in register B.
7. **MOV 40H, A:** Stores the quotient (from A) into memory location 40H.
8. **MOV 41H, B:** Stores the remainder (from B) into memory location 41H.

# Write a program to create square wave of 50 % duty cycle on P1.3 pin using timer. (4)

**Code (Assuming Timer 0, Mode 1):**

```assembly
ORG 0000H

MOV TMOD, #01H ; Set Timer 0 in Mode 1 (16-bit timer)

; Calculate Timer Reload Value (adjust for your crystal frequency)
; Example: Assuming 12 MHz crystal frequency
; Desired period = Time for HIGH + Time for LOW = 2 * Time for HIGH
; Let's make Time for HIGH = 1 ms (adjust as needed)
; Timer count = (Crystal Frequency / 12) * Time
;             = (12000000 /12) * 0.001 = 1000
; Reload Value = 65536 - Timer Count = 65536 - 1000 = 64536
; Split into higher and lower bytes:
MOV TH0, #0xFC   ; Higher byte of reload value
MOV TL0, #0x18   ; Lower byte of reload value

SETB P1.3   ; Initially set the pin HIGH
SETB TR0    ; Start Timer 0

HERE:
JNB TF0, HERE  ; Wait for Timer 0 overflow
CLR TF0        ; Clear the overflow flag
CPL P1.3       ; Toggle the pin
SJMP HERE      ; Repeat indefinitely
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ORG 0000H:** Sets the program starting address.

2. **MOV TMOD, #01H:** Configures Timer 0 to operate in Mode 1 (16-bit mode).

3. **Timer Reload Value Calculation:**

   - You'll need to adjust the calculation based on your crystal frequency and desired square wave period. The example assumes a 12 MHz crystal and aims for a 1 ms HIGH time (and 1 ms LOW time).

4. **MOV TH0, #0xFC / MOV TL0, #0x18:** Load the calculated reload value into Timer 0's high and low registers.

5. **SETB P1.3:** Initially set the output pin P1.3 to HIGH.

6. **SETB TR0:** Start running Timer 0.

7. **HERE / JNB TF0, HERE:** Create a loop waiting for the Timer 0 overflow flag (TF0) to be set.

8. **CLR TF0:** Clear the Timer 0 overflow flag.

9. **CPL P1.3:** Complement (toggle) the logic level of the P1.3 pin.

10. **SJMP HERE:** Jump back to the beginning of the loop, creating an infinite square wave generation.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Crystal Frequency:** Make sure to adjust the reload value calculation based on your specific crystal frequency.
- **Timer Mode:** Mode 1 is a common choice for square wave generation.
- **Output Pin:** Ensure that P1.3 is configured as an output pin.
- **Desired Period/Frequency:** Adjust the calculation to achieve your specific square wave timing requirements.

# Write an ALP to generate square wave on P1.1 using timer0 and mode 1. (4)

```assembly
ORG 0000H  ; Set program origin

MOV TMOD, #01H  ; Configure Timer 0 in Mode 1 (16-bit mode)

; Calculate Timer Reload Value (adjust for your desired frequency)
; Example: Assuming 11.0592 MHz crystal frequency for a 1 kHz square wave
; 1 kHz square wave has a period of 1 ms (0.001 seconds)
; Time for HIGH = Time for LOW = 0.5 ms (0.0005 seconds)
; Timer count = (Crystal Frequency / 12) * Time
;             = (11059200 / 12) * 0.0005
;             = 460.8
; Reload Value = 65536 - Timer Count = 65536 - 460 = 65076
; Split into higher and lower bytes:
MOV TH0, #0xFC   ; Higher byte of reload value (65076)
MOV TL0, #0x18   ; Lower byte of reload value (65076)

SETB P1.1   ; Initially set P1.1 HIGH
SETB TR0    ; Start Timer 0

HERE:
JNB TF0, HERE  ; Wait for Timer 0 to overflow
CLR TF0        ; Clear the overflow flag
CPL P1.1       ; Toggle the P1.1 pin
SJMP HERE      ; Loop back to create the square wave
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ORG 0000H:** Sets the starting address of your program.
2. **MOV TMOD, #01H:** Configures Timer 0 to operate in Mode 1, which is a 16-bit timer mode.
3. **Timer Reload Calculation:**
   - **You need to adjust this calculation based on your crystal frequency and the desired frequency of the square wave.**
   - The example aims for a 1 kHz square wave with a 11.0592 MHz crystal.
4. **MOV TH0, #0xFC / MOV TL0, #0x18:** Loads the calculated reload value into Timer 0's registers.
5. **SETB P1.1:** Sets the P1.1 pin HIGH initially.
6. **SETB TR0:** Starts Timer 0.
7. **HERE / JNB TF0, HERE:** Creates a loop that waits for the Timer 0 overflow flag (TF0).
8. **CLR TF0:** Clears the overflow flag.
9. **CPL P1.1:** Toggles the state of the P1.1 pin, changing it from HIGH to LOW or vice versa.
10. **SJMP HERE:** Jumps back to the label "HERE," creating a continuous square wave.

**Key Points:**

- **Crystal Frequency:** Replace the crystal frequency in the calculation with the actual value for your 8051 system.
- **Desired Frequency:** Modify the calculation to get the square wave frequency you need.
- **Pin Configuration:** Ensure that P1.1 is configured as an output pin.

# Write software delay loop using two registers and explain in brief. (4)

```assembly
ORG 0000H

DELAY:
MOV R0, #50D   ; Load a value into register R0 (adjust for delay)
MOV R1, #250D  ; Load a value into register R1 (adjust for delay)

DJNZ_R1:       ; Decrement R1 and jump if not zero
DJNZ R1, DJNZ_R1

DJNZ_R0:       ; Decrement R0 and jump if not zero
DJNZ R0, DJNZ_R0

RET            ; Return from the subroutine
```

**Explanation:**

1. **DELAY:** This label marks the beginning of your delay subroutine.

2. **MOV R0, #50D / MOV R1, #250D:** These instructions load initial values into two registers, R0 and R1. The larger the values, the longer the delay. You'll need to adjust these based on your crystal frequency and the desired delay length.

3. **DJNZ_R1 / DJNZ_R0:** These are "Decrement and Jump if Not Zero" instructions. They form two nested loops:
   - **Outer Loop (R0):** The outer loop decrements R0 and repeats until R0 reaches zero.
   - **Inner Loop (R1):** The inner loop decrements R1 and repeats until R1 reaches zero. Each time the inner loop runs, it reloads R1 with its initial value.

**How it Works:**

The nested loops create a series of decrement operations. The combination of instructions and the initial values in R0 and R1 determine the overall time the delay takes to execute.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Accuracy:** Software delays are not perfectly precise. Their timing depends on your crystal frequency and the number of instructions within the loop.
- **Crystal Frequency:** For more accurate delays, you'll need to calibrate the initial values (in R0 and R1) based on your crystal frequency.
- **Timer Alternatives:** For very precise delays, consider using the 8051's built-in timers instead of software delay loops.

# Write sequence of instructions for masking 4 lower bits of content of R2. (3)

```assembly
MOV A, R2      ; Copy the contents of R2 into the accumulator
ANL A, #0F0H   ; Perform a logical AND with 0F0H to mask the lower 4 bits
MOV R2, A      ; Move the result back into R2
```

**Explanation:**

1. **MOV A, R2:** This instruction copies the current value stored in register R2 into the accumulator (A).

2. **ANL A, #0F0H:** This performs a logical AND operation between the value in the accumulator (which now contains the original value of R2) and the hexadecimal value 0F0H. The result will be that:

   - Bits 4-7 of the accumulator will remain unchanged.
   - Bits 0-3 of the accumulator will become 0 (masked).

3. **MOV R2, A:** This instruction moves the modified contents of the accumulator (with the lower bits masked) back into register R2.

**Key Points**

- **Hexadecimal Mask:** The value 0F0H (binary: 1111 0000) is used as a mask because it has '1's in the bit positions you want to preserve and '0's in the bit positions you want to clear.
- **Masking:** Masking is a technique used to isolate or clear specific bits within a byte.

# Write sequence of instructions to fill internal memory location 20H to 2FH by data FFH. (3)

```assembly
MOV R0, #20H  ; Load starting address into a register (R0 in this case)
MOV A, #0FFH  ; Load the data to be filled into the accumulator

FILL_LOOP:
MOV @R0, A    ; Store the content of the accumulator into the memory location pointed to by R0
INC R0        ; Increment R0 to point to the next memory location
CJNE R0, #30H, FILL_LOOP  ; Compare R0 with the ending address + 1 (30H), jump to FILL_LOOP if not equal
```

**Explanation:**

1. **MOV R0, #20H:** Load the starting memory address (20H) into a register (we're using R0).

2. **MOV A, #0FFH:** Load the value you want to fill (FFH) into the accumulator.

3. **FILL_LOOP:** This label marks the beginning of the loop.

4. **MOV @R0, A:** This instruction uses indirect addressing. It stores the contents of the accumulator (FFH) into the memory location pointed to by the register R0.

5. **INC R0:** Increment the register R0 to point to the next memory location.

6. **CJNE R0, #30H, FILL_LOOP:** This instruction means "Compare and Jump if Not Equal." It compares the contents of R0 with the value 30H (which is the ending address + 1). If they are not equal, the program jumps back to the `FILL_LOOP` label, continuing the filling process.

**Key Points:**

- **Indirect Addressing:** The `@R0` syntax means that the contents of R0 are used as the memory address.
- **Loop Termination:** The CJNE instruction ensures the loop runs until memory location 2FH is filled.

# Write an ALP to add two 8 bit numbers stored at External memory location 2030h and 2031h. Store result in external memory location 2032h. (4)

```assembly
ORG 0000H  ; Set origin of the program

; Load data from external memory
MOV A, #30H    ; Load lower byte of the first number's address into A
MOVC A, @A+DPTR  ; Fetch the first number from external memory using DPTR
MOV B, A          ; Store the first number in register B

MOV A, #31H    ; Load lower byte of the second number's address into A
MOVC A, @A+DPTR  ; Fetch the second number from external memory

ADD A, B          ; Add the two numbers (result now in A)

MOV A, #32H    ;  Load lower byte of the result address into A
MOVX @DPTR, A  ; Store the result in external memory using DPTR

END            ; End of program
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ORG 0000H:** Sets the starting memory address for the program.

2. **MOV A, #30H / MOVC A, @A+DPTR:**

   - Loads the lower byte of the first number's address (2030H) into the accumulator (A).
   - Uses the DPTR (Data Pointer) register to access external memory. The `MOVC` instruction fetches the byte at the address calculated by adding the contents of A to the value in DPTR.

3. **MOV B, A:** Stores the fetched first number in register B.

4. **MOV A, #31H / MOVC A, @A+DPTR** Repeats the process to fetch the second number from address 2031H.

5. **ADD A, B:** Adds the two numbers together, storing the result in the accumulator (A).

6. **MOV A, #32H / MOVX @DPTR, A:**
   - Loads the lower byte of the result's address (2032H) into A.
   - Uses `MOVX` for external memory access, storing the result from A at the address pointed to by DPTR.

**Important Notes:**

- **DPTR Setup:** Ensure that your DPTR register is correctly initialized to point to the start of external memory before executing this code.
- **MOVC vs. MOVX:** `MOVC` is used to read from code memory (usually within the 8051), while `MOVX` is used for external data memory.

# Draw circuit diagram for interfacing 8 LEDS on port 1. Write a program to flash LEDS in sequence ( on 1 LED at a time) with suitable time delay. (7)

**Circuit Diagram**

1. **8051 Microcontroller:** The heart of the circuit. Choose your specific 8051 microcontroller model.
2. **LEDs:** 8 regular LEDs (choose a suitable color).
3. **Current-Limiting Resistors:** One resistor for each LED. Calculate the resistor value using this formula:

   ```
   Resistor Value (Ohms) = (Supply Voltage - LED Forward Voltage) / Desired LED Current
   ```

   - Typical forward voltage for LEDs is around 1.8V - 3.3V (check your LED datasheet)
   - Common LED current is around 20mA (0.02A)

4. **Connections:**
   - Connect one leg of each LED to a separate pin on Port 1 of the 8051 (P1.0 - P1.7).
   - Connect the other leg of each LED to a current-limiting resistor, and then connect those resistors to ground.

**Example Circuit (Schematic would be ideal, but I'll provide a textual description):**

- **Assume 5V supply and standard red LEDs (2V forward voltage)**
- P1.0 ---[330 Ohm Resistor]--- LED --- GND
- P1.1 ---[330 Ohm Resistor]--- LED --- GND
- ... (Repeat connections the same way for P1.2 to P1.7)

**8051 Program**

```assembly
ORG 0000H

START:
MOV R0, #00H  ; Initialize a counter
MOV A, #01H   ; Initial LED pattern (0000 0001)

LOOP:
MOV P1, A     ; Output the pattern to Port 1
CALL DELAY    ; Call a delay subroutine
ROR A         ; Rotate the pattern one bit to the right
INC R0        ; Increment counter
CJNE R0, #08, LOOP ; Repeat until 8 LEDs have been lit

SJMP START    ; Restart the sequence

; Simple Delay Subroutine
DELAY:
MOV R1, #200D  ; Adjust these values for
MOV R2, #00D   ; desired delay time
DJNZ R2, $
DJNZ R1, $
RET
```

**Explanation**

- **START:** Sets up a counter and initial LED pattern
- **LOOP:** Outputs pattern to the LEDs, calls delay, rotates the '1' bit for the next LED.
- **CJNE:** Checks if 8 shifts have occurred, restarts if not.
- **DELAY:** A basic software delay using nested loops.

**Key Points**

- **Port Output:** Ensure Port 1 is configured as output.
- **Resistor Calculation:** Calculate the correct resistor value for your LEDs and supply voltage.
- **Delay Adjustment:** Modify values in the DELAY subroutine for your desired LED flashing speed.

# Write a program to separate data 71h stored in accumulator , in two registers R3=07h and R4=01h. (4)

We'll use a combination of bit-shifting and masking operations:

```assembly
MOV A, #71H   ; Load 71h into the accumulator

; Extract lower 4 bits (R3)
MOV R3, A     ; Store the value of A in R3
AND A, #0FH   ; Mask off the upper 4 bits (keep only the lower nibble)

; Extract upper 4 bits (R4)
MOV R4, A     ; The accumulator now holds only the upper nibble
SHR A         ; Shift right by 4 positions (move upper nibble to lower)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **MOV A, #71H:** Load the value 71h into the accumulator (A).

2. **Extract lower 4 bits:**

   - **MOV R3, A:** Store the original value from the accumulator into R3. Now both the accumulator and R3 have the value 71h.
   - **AND A, #0FH:** Perform a logical AND operation with 0Fh (00001111 in binary) to mask off the upper 4 bits in the accumulator. Now, the accumulator only holds 00000111 (which is 7).

3. **Extract upper 4 bits**
   - **MOV R4, A:** Store the masked value (the upper nibble, now in the lower 4 bits) into R4.
   - **SHR A:** Shift the accumulator right by 4 positions. This moves the upper nibble (01) into the lower 4 bits, and the accumulator now holds 00000001 (which is 1).

**At the end of this code:**

- **R3:** Contains 00000111 (7)
- **R4:** Contains 00000001 (1)

# Write a program to add first 9 numbers ( 1 to 9). Store answer at memory location 77h of RAM. (4)

```assembly
ORG 0000H       ; Set the program's starting address

MOV R0, #00H     ; Initialize a register (R0) as the accumulator
MOV R1, #09H     ; Initialize a counter (R1) to keep track of numbers

LOOP:
ADD A, R1        ; Add the current number (from R1) to the accumulator
DJNZ R1, LOOP    ; Decrement the counter and jump to LOOP if not zero
MOV 77H, A       ; Store the result (sum) in memory location 77H

END              ; End of program
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ORG 0000H:** Sets the starting address of your code.
2. **MOV R0, #00H:** Initializes register R0 to 0. R0 will store the running sum.
3. **MOV R1, #09H:** Initializes register R1 to 9, which will be our counter.
4. **LOOP:** This label marks the beginning of the loop.
5. **ADD A, R1:** Adds the value in R1 to the accumulator (where the running sum is stored).
6. **DJNZ R1, LOOP:** Decrements R1 and jumps back to the `LOOP` label if R1 is not zero. This loop continues for 9 iterations.
7. **MOV 77H, A:** After the loop, the accumulator (A) holds the sum of the first 9 numbers. This instruction stores that sum in memory location 77H.
8. **END:** Indicates the end of the program.

**Key Points**

- **Registers:** We use registers for calculations and as a loop counter.
- **DJNZ Instruction:** The 'Decrement and Jump if Not Zero' instruction creates the loop.

# Write assembly code to exchange data of R1 and R2 using PUSH & POP. (3)

```assembly
PUSH R1  ; Push the contents of R1 onto the stack
PUSH R2  ; Push the contents of R2 onto the stack
POP R1   ; Pop the top value from the stack (originally from R2) into R1
POP R2   ; Pop the next value from the stack (originally from R1) into R2
```

**Explanation:**

1. **PUSH R1:** Pushes the contents of register R1 onto the system stack.
2. **PUSH R2:** Pushes the contents of register R2 onto the stack (on top of R1's value).
3. **POP R1:** Pops the top value from the stack and stores it into R1. Since we pushed R2 last, this will be R2's original value.
4. **POP R2:** Pops the next value from the stack and stores it into R2. This will be R1's original value.

**Result:**

After executing this code, the values in R1 and R2 will have been effectively swapped.

**Important Note:**

The stack in the 8051 microcontroller operates in a LIFO (Last In, First Out) manner. This means the last value pushed onto the stack will be the first value popped off.

# Write assembly code for copying data 99H to RAM memory locations 30H to 50H using counter. (3)

```assembly
ORG 0000H  ; Set the program's starting address

MOV R0, #30H   ; Load the starting memory address into R0
MOV R1, #21    ; Initialize counter (21 locations from 30H to 50H inclusive)
MOV A, #99H    ; Load the data to be copied into the accumulator

COPY_LOOP:
MOV @R0, A     ; Store the data from the accumulator into the memory location pointed to by R0
INC R0         ; Increment R0 to point to the next memory location
DJNZ R1, COPY_LOOP ; Decrement the counter and jump back to COPY_LOOP if not zero

END            ; End of program
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ORG 0000H:** Sets the program's starting memory address in the code space.

2. **MOV R0, #30H:** Loads the starting RAM address (30H) into register R0.

3. **MOV R1, #21:** Loads the counter value into register R1. Since there are 21 memory locations from 30H to 50H (inclusive), we initialize our counter with 21.

4. **MOV A, #99H:** Loads the data (99H) to be copied into the accumulator.

5. **COPY_LOOP:** This label marks the beginning of the loop.

6. **MOV @R0, A:** Uses indirect addressing to store the contents of the accumulator (99H) into the memory location currently pointed to by R0.

7. **INC R0:** Increments R0 to point to the next memory location where the data will be copied.

8. **DJNZ R1, COPY_LOOP:** Decrements the counter in R1 and jumps back to the `COPY_LOOP` label if the counter is not zero. The loop continues until the counter reaches zero.

# Draw a diagram to connect 8 switches with port P1 and 8 LEDs with port P2 and write a program to show status of switch on LED. (If switch is ON then LED is ON and if switch is OFF, LED is OFF). (7)

**Circuit Diagram**

**Components:**

- 8051 Microcontroller
- 8 Switches (simple push-button or toggle switches)
- 8 LEDs
- 8 Current-limiting resistors (calculate the value based on your specific LEDs)
- Breadboard and connecting wires

**Connections:**

1. **Port P1 (Input):**

   - Connect one end of each switch to a separate pin on Port P1 (P1.0 - P1.7).
   - Connect the other end of each switch to the microcontroller's ground (GND).

2. **Port P2 (Output):**
   - Connect the anode (longer leg) of each LED to a separate pin on Port P2 (P2.0 - P2.7).
   - Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of each LED to a current-limiting resistor. Connect the other end of each resistor to ground (GND).

**Important:**

- **Pull-up Resistors:** You'll likely need pull-up resistors (around 10k Ohms) connected between each input pin on Port P1 and the supply voltage (VCC). This ensures a defined logic level when the switches are open.

**8051 Program**

```assembly
ORG 0000H

LOOP:
MOV A, P1     ; Read the input from Port P1
MOV P2, A     ; Transfer the input directly to Port P2
SJMP LOOP     ; Jump back to continuously monitor the switches

END           ; End of program
```

**Explanation**

- **ORG 0000H:** Sets the program's starting address.
- **LOOP:** Label for the main program loop.
- **MOV A, P1:** Reads the entire byte from Port P1 (the status of all 8 switches) and stores it in the accumulator (A).
- **MOV P2, A:** Directly transfers the value from the accumulator to Port P2, controlling the LEDs to mirror the switch states.
- **SJMP LOOP:** Short jump back to the beginning of the loop for continuous monitoring.

**Key Points**

- **Switch Logic:** Make sure your switch connections result in a logic HIGH when pressed and a logic LOW when released.
- **LED Considerations:** Ensure Port P2 can handle the current requirements of your LEDs.

# Write a program to find largest number from 10 numbers starting at external RAM location 2000h. Store the largest number in internal RAM location 20h. (4)

```assembly
ORG 0000H  ; Set the program's starting address

MOV DPTR, #2000H  ; Initialize DPTR to point to the start of external RAM
MOV R0, #10       ; Initialize a counter to track 10 numbers
MOV A, @DPTR      ; Load the first number into the accumulator
MOV 20H, A        ; Initialize internal RAM location 20H with the first number (assume it's the largest initially)

LOOP:
INC DPTR          ; Move to the next number in external RAM
MOVC A, @A+DPTR   ; Fetch the current number
CJNE A, 20H, NEXT ; Compare the current number with the largest so far
MOV 20H, A        ; If the current number is larger, update the largest

NEXT:
DJNZ R0, LOOP     ; Decrement the counter and loop if not zero

END               ; End of program
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ORG 0000H:** Sets the starting address of the program.
2. **MOV DPTR, #2000H:** Initializes the data pointer (DPTR) to point to the start of the numbers in external RAM (2000h).
3. **MOV R0, #10:** Initializes a counter (R0) to keep track of the 10 numbers.
4. **MOV A, @DPTR / MOV 20H, A:** Loads the first number into the accumulator and also stores it in internal RAM location 20H as our initial assumption for the largest number.
5. **LOOP:** Labels the beginning of the loop.
6. **INC DPTR:** Increments DPTR to point to the next number.
7. **MOVC A, @A+DPTR:** Fetches the current number from external RAM using DPTR.
8. **CJNE A, 20H, NEXT:** Compares the current number (in A) with the assumed largest number (at memory location 20H). If they are not equal, it jumps to the `NEXT` label.
9. **MOV 20H, A:** If the current number is larger, replaces the content of memory location 20H (our largest number) with it.
10. **NEXT:** Label for continuing to the next number.
11. **DJNZ R0, LOOP:** Decrements the counter (R0) and jumps back to `LOOP` if the counter is not zero.

**At the end of this program, the largest number will be stored in internal RAM location 20H.**

# Add two nos. given in R0 AND R1. Put the result in external RAM location 1030h (LSB) and 1031h (MSB). (3)

```assembly
ORG 0000H ; Set the starting address of the program

; Add the numbers in R0 and R1
ADD A, R0  ; Add the contents of R0 to the accumulator
MOV R1, A  ; Store the result in R1 (in case of overflow)

; Store the result in external RAM
MOV DPTR, #1030H   ; Load DPTR with the starting external RAM address
MOV A, R1          ; Move the lower byte of the result into A
MOVX @DPTR, A      ; Store the lower byte at 1030h
INC DPTR           ; Increment DPTR to point to 1031h
MOV A, R2          ; Move the higher byte of the result (if any) into A
MOVX @DPTR, A      ; Store the higher byte at 1031h

END                ; End of program
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ORG 0000H:** Sets the starting address of the program.
2. **ADD A, R1:** Adds the contents of registers R0 and R1, storing the result in the accumulator (A).
3. **MOV R1, A:** Stores the result in R1 as well. This handles the case where the addition results in a carry (overflow), ensuring the MSB is stored correctly.
4. **MOV DPTR, #1030H:** Initializes the DPTR (Data Pointer) with the starting address (1030h) in external RAM.
5. **MOV A, R1 / MOVX @DPTR, A:** Moves the lower byte of the result to the accumulator and then stores it at the location pointed to by DPTR (1030h) using the `MOVX` instruction (for external memory access).
6. **INC DPTR / MOV A, R2 / MOVX @DPTR, A:** Increments DPTR to address 1031h, moves the higher byte (if any) of the result into the accumulator, and stores it using `MOVX`.

**Key Points:**

- **DPTR Setup:** Make sure your DPTR is correctly set up to point to the external memory region you want to use.
- **Overflow Handling:** This code correctly handles the potential overflow when adding 8-bit numbers.

# Write an ALP to exchange the content of A and B (3)

**Method 1: Using a Temporary Register (e.g., R0)**

```assembly
MOV R0, A   ; Store the contents of A in a temporary register (R0)
MOV A, B    ; Move the contents of B into A
MOV B, R0   ; Move the original contents of A (from R0) into B
```

**Method 2: Using the XCH Instruction**

```assembly
XCH A, B    ; Directly exchange the contents of A and B
```

**Method 3: Using XOR Operations**

```assembly
XOR A, B    ; XOR the contents of A and B, result in A
XCH A, B    ; Exchange A and B
XOR A, B    ; XOR A and B again (result in original value of A, now in B)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Method 1:** This is the most general approach, using a temporary register to hold one of the values during the swap.
- **Method 2:** The `XCH` instruction is specifically designed for exchanging values between the accumulator and another register. It's the most efficient way if your 8051 microcontroller supports it.
- **Method 3:** This method uses the XOR (Exclusive OR) operation, which has the interesting property that when you XOR a value with itself, the result is zero. This allows for a clever exchange mechanism.

# Write an ALP to multiply the content of A and B. (3)

```assembly
ORG 0000H  ; Set program origin

MUL AB     ; Multiply the accumulator (A) by register B. Result stored in A (LSB) and B (MSB)

END        ; End of program
```

**Explanation:**

- **ORG 0000H:** Indicates the starting address of the program's code.
- **MUL AB:** This is the core multiplication instruction. It multiplies the contents of the accumulator and register B. The 16-bit result is stored across both the accumulator (lower 8 bits) and register B (higher 8 bits).

**Important Notes:**

- **8-bit Limitation:** The 8051 can only directly multiply 8-bit numbers. If you need to multiply larger numbers, you'll have to implement a multi-byte multiplication algorithm using a series of additions and shifts.
- **Result Location:** Remember that the lower byte of the result will be in the accumulator (A) and the higher byte will be in register B after the multiplication.

**Example:**

If A = 5 (00000101) and B = 3 (00000011), then after `MUL AB`:

- A (Accumulator) would contain 15 (00001111) - the lower byte
- B would contain 0 (00000000) - the higher byte (in this case, it's zero)

# Write an ALP to divide the content of A and B. (3)

```assembly
ORG 0000H  ; Set program origin

DIV AB     ; Divide accumulator (A) by register B. Quotient in A, remainder in B

END        ; End of program
```

**Explanation:**

- **ORG 0000H:** Sets the program's starting address.
- **DIV AB:** This is the core division instruction. It divides the contents of the accumulator (which should contain the dividend) by the contents of register B (the divisor). After the division:
  - **Quotient:** Stored in the accumulator (A)
  - **Remainder:** Stored in register B

**Important Notes**

- **Integer Division:** The 8051's DIV instruction performs integer division, meaning any fractional part of the result will be discarded.
- **Zero Division:** Ensure that the value in register B is not zero before performing the division. Dividing by zero will cause an overflow flag (OV) to be set in the program status word (PSW).

**Example:**

If A = 10 (00001010) and B = 3 (00000011), then after `DIV AB`:

- A (Accumulator) would contain 3 (00000011) – the quotient
- B would contain 1 (00000001) – the remainder

# Write a program to copy block of 8 data starting from location 100h to 200h.

Here's an assembly program for the 8051 microcontroller to copy a block of 8 bytes of data from starting location 100H to destination location 200H:

```assembly
ORG 0000H  ; Program starts at memory location 0000H

; Initialization
MOV DPTR, #100H   ; Set DPTR to point to the source block (100H)
MOV R0, #200H     ; Set R0 to point to the destination block (200H)
MOV R1, #08H      ; Set R1 as the loop counter (8 bytes to copy)

COPY_LOOP:
MOVX A, @DPTR   ; Read a byte from the source using DPTR
MOVX @R0, A     ; Write the byte to the destination using R0
INC DPTR        ; Increment DPTR to point to the next source byte
INC R0          ; Increment R0 to point to the next destination byte
DJNZ R1, COPY_LOOP ; Decrement R1 and jump if not zero

; End of Program (You can add more code here or an infinite loop)
END
```

**Explanation**

1. **ORG 0000H:** This directive tells the assembler to place the code starting from memory location 0000H.

2. **Initialization:**

   - We load the Data Pointer (DPTR) with the starting address of the source block (100H).
   - Register R0 is loaded with the starting address of the destination block (200H).
   - Register R1 is initialized to 8, which is the number of bytes we want to copy.

3. **COPY_LOOP:**

   - `MOVX A, @DPTR`: Reads a byte from external RAM pointed to by DPTR and stores it in the accumulator.
   - `MOVX @R0, A`: Writes the byte from the accumulator to external RAM pointed to by R0.
   - `INC DPTR`, `INC R0`: Increment both DPTR and R0 to move to the next memory locations.
   - `DJNZ R1, COPY_LOOP`: Decrement R1 and jump back to the 'COPY_LOOP' label if R1 is not zero (meaning we haven't copied all 8 bytes yet).

4. **END:** Signifies the end of the assembly program.

**Key Points**

- This assumes you have external RAM where you are storing the data.
- You may need to adapt the addresses (100H and 200H) if your data is stored elsewhere.

# Write a program to add two bytes of data and store result in R0 register.

Here's the 8051 assembly code to add two bytes of data and store the result in register R0:

```assembly
; Data initialization - you might load these from memory in a real program
MOV A, #56H   ; Load the first byte of data into the accumulator
MOV B, #23H   ; Load the second byte of data into register B

; Addition
ADD A, B       ; Add the value in register B to the accumulator
MOV R0, A     ; Store the result (which is now in the accumulator) into R0

; End of program (you might do something with the result or add an infinite loop here)
END
```

**Explanation**

1. **Data Initialization:**

   - `MOV A, #56H`: Loads the immediate value 56H (hexadecimal) into the accumulator (A register).
   - `MOV B, #23H`: Loads the immediate value 23H into register B.

2. **Addition:**

   - `ADD A, B`: Adds the value in register B to the value in the accumulator. The result remains in the accumulator.

3. **Storing the Result:**
   - `MOV R0, A`: Moves the value from the accumulator (which holds the sum) into register R0.

**Important Points**

- You can replace the `MOV` instructions with ways to get data from other sources (memory, user input, etc.).
- Make sure that the sum of your two data bytes can fit into 8 bits to avoid overflow.
